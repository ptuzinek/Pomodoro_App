# Developer notes ðŸ‘¾
The Application was build using BLoC architecture. Its performance was optimized by profiling the app using DevTools and by minimizing widgets rebuilds using Android Studio's tools for tracking builds. The costly PomodoroTimer widget performance was enhanced by the use of const widgets that are not rebuild even when its parent is rebuilding. Also the buildWhen method was used to minimize number of re-builds.
Code responsible for the animation of turning the clock is implemented inside the UI code.
